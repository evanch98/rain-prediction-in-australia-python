Rain-prediction-in-Australia machine learning models in Python. This project is part of the [IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer).

## Project Description
- Use a rainfall dataset from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology.
- Clean the data and apply different classification algorithms to the data.
- Algorithms include
  - Linear Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Decision Trees
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine
- The results are reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when they are applicable:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Jaccard Index
  - F1-Score
  - LogLoss
  - Mean Absolute Error
  - Mean Squared Error
  - R2-Score
